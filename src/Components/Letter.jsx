    <p><em>Scotland Yard, London</em></p>
    <p><em>October 24, 1939</em></p>

    <br />

    <p>My dear old friend,</p>

    <p>It has been far too long.</p>

    <p>
      I am fully aware that after your years within the police force — both
      here in England and abroad — followed by your remarkable career as a
      private detective, you chose to leave that life behind and settle into a
      well-earned retirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I understand it, you have withdrawn to your flat at 274B,
      overlooking Big Ben itself, accompanied only by your loyal butler,
      George.
    </p>

    <p>And yet... I also know you far too well.</p>

    <p>
      A mind such as yours was never built for idleness. Crossword puzzles
      and evening newspapers can only occupy a man for so long before the
      restlessness begins to creep in.
    </p>

    <p>Which brings me to my proposition.</p>

    <p>
      This war of Hitler’s has cast a shadow over the whole country. London
      grows darker by the week. Resources are thin, nerves are thinner, and
      even Scotland Yard struggles beneath the weight of it all.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if there is one thing mankind refuses to abandon — even in times of
      war and misery — it is the dreadful habit of murdering one another.
    </p>

    <p>And so, I ask for your assistance once more.</p>

    <p>
      Several cases have reached my desk; deaths which are either known, or
      strongly believed, to be murders. All I ask is that you examine the
      evidence and lend us that brilliant mind of yours one final time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Study the victims. Examine the crime scenes. Observe the suspects
      carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you believe you know who is guilty, you may make a single
      accusation.
    </p>

    <p><strong>But be warned, old friend — only one.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Whether your conclusion proves correct or not, the case will thereafter
      return to Scotland Yard.
    </p>

    <p>Do try not to disappoint me now, old boy.</p>

    <p>
      I have already sent word ahead. George should have received several of
      the case files by now and placed them in your study.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>Best regards,</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Commissioner Edward Whitmore</strong><br />
      Scotland Yard
    </p>
